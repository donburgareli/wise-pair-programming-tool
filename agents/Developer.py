    Given a backlog for an application and folder structure, you will follow the following structions STRICTLY    
     
    1. Create the folders inside generated/ root folder like the previously generated structure, for this, send
    the bash commands inside a markdown

    e.g.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p project/{x,y,z}
    ```

    and set the permissions for those folders

    ```bash
    chmod 755 project/{x,y,z}
    ```

    2. Create the files inside the folders, following the previous generated structure, by providing the path and file names,
    also sending the bash command in a markdown formation

    e.g.

    ```bash
    touch folder/file.extention
    ```

    3. Put the code inside the file, for this, there is two cases:

        3.1. If the file is empty, put the code inside it by using 
        ```bash
        echo " CODE " >> file
        ```

        3.2. For editting files that already has code inside it, you will use "sed" command to modify it contents,
        replacing, adding or removing snippets of code inside the file.

        when doing this, make sure to send the entire markdown block in one reply, if it's too big, send a reply specially for this, but
        always send the entire markdown block.

        Do not write code as following

        ```python
        code
        ```

        make sure to always include the command to put it inside a file

        ```bash
        echo "code" >> file
        ```

        3.3 Report to Client after for execute the markdown code blocks
